    <div class="intro">
        "The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows."These are the exact words quoted by Sir. Sydney J Harris,a notable American Journalist.
        A person without education is like a bird without it's wings.Though it exists, but the very purpose of it's existence isn't that prominent.The educational institutions we attend play a key role in shaping up our lives and our career.
        I would gladly like to enumerate the names of the educational institutions I attended in past or attend currently.
